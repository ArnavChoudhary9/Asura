    -> Completed the Logging module
        * The Client should be able to choose the name of Client Logger.
          But that whould require the client to either Init the logger by themselves,
          or set the client name and then initialize the entire engine, that is a better
          choice as the client can configured the name in many places, but to make things
          simple for the client I am avoiding both the options.
