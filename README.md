# Asura

A 3D Game Engine Written in Python.

I previlously wrote a game engine in Python called PI. But dropped it mid-way, as it got really complicated and jumbled. But this one is much cleaner.

## Dependencies

1. Python (>=3.10)

1. virtualenv package: `pip install virtualenv`

## Getting Started

It is recommended that if you are here to just make games using the engine you should download the precompiled binaries from the releases section, as they are easier to setup and run quicker.

* Running the repository:

  1. Start by cloning the repository: `git clone https://github.com/HotShot0901/Asura`

  1. Reinstantiate the virtual environment: `virtualenv virtualenv`

  1. Activate the virtual environment: `virtualenv\Scripts\activate`

  1. Run the editor: `python Tarka\Tarka.py`

* Runnig precompiled binaries:
  
  Extract the .zip file and run `Tarka.exe`

  > NOTE: It may take some time to start, it is normal.
